## What is an AIP?
AIP stands for AOL Improvement Proposal. It's a concise specification for something new to be added to the Apes Online community.

## Rationale
AIPs are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting community input, and for documenting design decisions.

## Types
There are two types of AIP:
- A **Technical** AIP is for proposals related to software engineering (d-apps, smart contracts, bots, etc).
- A **Social** AIP is for proposals related to how we interact in the community (events, games, airdrops, etc).

## Format

## Process

## History
This document was derived heavily from Ethereum's EIP01 written by Martin Becze and Hudson Jameson which in turn was derived heavily by Bitcoin's BIP-0001 written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from Python's PEP-0001.
